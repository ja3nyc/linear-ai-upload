# Linear AI Issue Creator

This application allows users to upload images to automatically create Linear issues using Google AI. It analyzes the uploaded images and creates structured Linear issues with titles, descriptions, priorities, and tags.

## Features

- **Linear OAuth Integration**: Securely authenticate with your Linear account
- **Image Upload**: Upload screenshots, diagrams, wireframes, or any visual content
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Google Generative AI to analyze images
- **Automatic Issue Creation**: Creates structured Linear issues based on image analysis
- **Team Selection**: Choose which Linear team to create issues for
- **No Database Required**: Works without any persistent storage

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A Linear account with admin access to create OAuth applications
- A Google AI API key

### Configuration

1. **Linear OAuth Setup**:
   - Go to your Linear workspace settings
   - Navigate to "API" â†’ "OAuth applications"
   - Create a new OAuth application
   - Set the redirect URI to: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/linear-oauth` or whatever your development URL is
   - Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

2. **Google AI Setup**:
   - Go to the [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/)
   - Get your API key from the settings page

3. **Environment Variables**:
   Copy the sample `.env.local` file and fill in your credentials:
   ```
   # Linear OAuth Configuration
   LINEAR_CLIENT_ID=your-linear-client-id
   LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET=your-linear-client-secret
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LINEAR_CLIENT_ID=your-linear-client-id

   # URL Configuration
   # For production deployment with custom domain:
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app-domain.com
   # Note: VERCEL_URL is automatically set by Vercel

   # Auth Secret
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=generate-a-random-string-here

   # Google AI Configuration  
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-ai-api-key
   ```

   **URL Configuration Note:**
   - For **production with custom domain**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your full URL (including https://)
   - For **Vercel deployments**: If you don't set NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL, the app will use VERCEL_URL automatically
   - For **local development**: The app will use your local URL automatically
   - The URL resolution follows this priority:
     1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (if set)
     2. `VERCEL_URL` (automatically set by Vercel)
     3. Browser's `window.location.origin` (for local development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Developer Notes

#### URL Handling
The application uses a centralized approach for URL resolution with the `getBaseUrl()` helper function in `src/utils/urlHelpers.ts`. When working with URLs:

- All redirects and URL construction should use this function to ensure consistency
- The function handles all environment contexts (development, Vercel deployment, custom domains)

This approach ensures the same URL logic is applied throughout the application, preventing redirect mismatches in the OAuth flow.

## Usage

1. Sign in with your Linear account
2. Select a team from the dropdown
3. Upload an image (screenshot, diagram, wireframe, etc.)
4. Click "Analyze & Create Issue"
5. View the created issue and AI analysis

## Technologies Used

- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- Linear SDK
- Google AI SDK

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
